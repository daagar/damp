daagar's aardwolf and mudlet package

# What it is

`damp` is a biased set of scripts for use with the [Mudlet][] mud client, and the DIKU MUD [Aardwolf][]. "Biased" in 
this case means it caters to the preferences and whims of the author, without a huge attempt at being generically
friendly to all players. In other words, your mileage may vary. It is up on github so I don't lose it, since my 
attention wanders and this project goes dormant for years at a time until I get the bug to mess with it again.

# What is isn't

Aardwolf has an official mud client, "[Aardmush][]", created by Fiendish and Lasher based on [MUSHClient][]. As well,
there are excellent plugins by the likes of Bast and WinkleWinkle that excend Aardmush even further. While `damp`
will certainly imitate/emulate/copy some of those features, it is in no way intended to be a replacement or
competition to them. It will most likely never come even remotely close to being able to replace their
functionality. 

# Er... so, why?

Fair question! There is one overriding reason why this project exists at all: I prefer the mapper in Mudlet. While
the solution provided by MUSHClient is pretty clever, is isn't a "true" mapping interface because of how it
is designed. It is also fun to tinker around with mudlet/lua/etc. Aardwolf is a particularly good mud for tinkering
because of its excellent use of GMCP. Mudlet, as stated, is great because of its GMCP support and a "true" 
mapper. 

# What about MAG (Mudlet Aardwolf GUI)

This project has no relation to the [MAG][] project.

# So can I use it?

By all means! But understand it'll be quite rough around the edges. And in the middle. Feel free to submit
issues (or even pull requests), but don't be offended if they are ignored for stretches of time. To really give you 
a warm fuzzy feeling, understand that I'm also a new player to Aardwolf - so there are probably 'obvious' things
that the scripts should do/track/handle that aren't there because I don't even know they exist. The thought is that
I add things as I find them...
